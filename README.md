# Start-Stop System
This is a self-study project to improve my knowlegde in AVR microcontroller and C++ programming skill
+ Tools: Proteus, Codevision
+ Tasks: Simulate circuit diagram on Proteus, build code in Codevision and load hex file to AVR microcontroller, test system and debug,...
+ Working principle
  - When the driver steps on the brake pedal to stop the vehicle, after a few seconds the engine will completely shut down (both the fuel supply and ignition systems will temporarily stop working) but the air conditioning fan or other systems such as rearview mirror, speakers... still operate normally thanks to the energy from the battery. When the driver want the car to work again, just needs to step on the gas pedal. But when the driver does not step on the accelerator for a period of time, the car automatically switches off the electrical system.
